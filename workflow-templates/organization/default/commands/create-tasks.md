# Create Tasks

Create a tasks list with sub-tasks to execute a feature based on its spec.

## Hierarchy
- **Organization**: Default workflow (this file)
- **Project**: Can override with own `instructions/create-tasks.md`
- **Repository**: Inherits from project or org

Refer to instructions:
@../instructions/core/create-tasks.md

Or if overridden at project level:
@[project]/instructions/create-tasks.md
