# Analyze Product

Analyze your product's codebase and install workflow structure.

## Hierarchy Context

This is typically an organization-level workflow used to:
1. Analyze existing codebases
2. Set up the HiveMind workflow structure
3. Create initial product documentation

## When to Use
- Setting up a new project in the organization
- Onboarding an existing codebase
- Documenting current implementation state

## Note
This workflow creates the foundation that project-level workflows will build upon.
It understands and sets up the org→project→repo hierarchy.
